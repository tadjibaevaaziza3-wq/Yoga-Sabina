## Data Schemas
*To be defined after Discovery Phase.*

## Behavioral Rules
1. **Tone**: Calm authority, therapeutic expertise, luxury premium aesthetic.
2. **Deterministic Logic**: Use Python scripts in `tools/` for automated tasks.
3. **Clean Code**: Zero tolerance for unused "garbage" files or dead code.
4. **Next.js 15 Standards**: Always await `params` in routes; use standard Next.js 15 patterns.

## Architectural Invariants
- **A.N.T. Architecture**:
    - `architecture/`: Technical SOPs.
    - Navigation: Decision-making logic.
    - `tools/`: Atomic Python scripts.
- **Tailwind v4**: Use `@utility` for custom styles.
