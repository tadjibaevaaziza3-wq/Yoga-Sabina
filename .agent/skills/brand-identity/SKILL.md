# Baxtli Men — A Luxury Therapeutic Yoga Experience

This skill defines the visual, structural, and verbal identity of **Baxtli Men**, a premium yoga therapy platform founded by **Sabina Polatova**.

## Brand Essence
Baxtli Men is a boutique wellness studio in digital form. It offers a luxury therapeutic experience, not mass-market fitness. The brand is built on **Sabina Polatova's** 7 years of expertise as a Yoga Trainer and Therapeutic Yoga Specialist.

## Core Pillars
- **Therapeutic Authority**: Focus on therapy-based yoga, posture correction, and stress recovery.
- **Feminine Strength**: Balanced, intentional, and grounded movement.
- **Luxury Minimalism**: Refined aesthetics, cinematic layouts, and vast whitespace.
- **Structured Methodology**: Every practice is backed by deep knowledge and a measured approach.

## Visual Language
The interface must feel like a high-end wellness editorial.
- **Editorial Typography**: Use elegant serifs for headlines and clean sans-serifs for body text.
- **Cinematic Layouts**: Large hero sections, whitespace as a design element, and vertical rhythm.
- **Subtle Elegance**: Soft shadow layers, refined rounded corners, and a calm, emerald-based palette.
- **Strict Token Adherence**: No ad-hoc styling. Use the defined `design-tokens.json` for all UI elements.

## Implementation Principles
- **Minimalism**: Remove clutter. Focus on one primary action or message per view.
- **Subtle Interaction**: Transitions must be soft and deliberate. Avoid aggressive or flashy animations.
- **Premium Consistency**: Both the TMA Mobile App and the Admin Panel must reflect the same level of luxury and care.

## Tone & Conduct
- **Elegant & Grounded**: Speak with the authority of an expert but the warmth of a mentor.
- **Measured**: Sentences should be short, clear, and intentional.
- **Safe & Guided**: The goal is to make the user feel elevated and respected, never rushed or pressured.
